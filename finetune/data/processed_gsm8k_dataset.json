So, the cost of producing one DVD is $6.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the selling price of one DVD**\n\nJames sells each DVD for 2.5 times the cost of production, which is $6. So, the selling price of one DVD is:\n\n$6 x 2.5 = $15\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the daily revenue**\n\nJames sells 500 DVDs a day for 5 days a week. So, the daily revenue is:\n\n500 DVDs/day x $15/DVD = $7500/day\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the weekly revenue**\n\nSince James sells DVDs for 5 days a week, the weekly revenue is:\n\n$7500/day x 5 days/week = $37,500/week\n\n**Step 5",

    "positive_example": "system\n\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant who answers questions step by step.\nuser\n\nThe profit from a business transaction is shared among 2 business partners, Mike and Johnson in the ratio 2:5 respectively. If Johnson got $2500, how much will Mike have after spending some of his share on a shirt that costs $200?\nassistant\n\nLet's break this down step by step.\n\n1. The ratio of the profit shared between Mike and Johnson is 2:5, which means for every 2 parts that Mike gets, Johnson gets 5 parts.\n2. Since Johnson got $2500, we can set up an equation to represent the ratio:\n\n2x = 2500 - 5x\n\nWhere x is the amount of profit that Mike gets.\n\n3. To solve for x, we can simplify the equation:\n\n2x + 5x = 2500\n7x = 2500\nx = 2500 / 7\nx = 357.14\n\nSo, Mike gets $357.14.\n\n4. Mike spends $200 on a shirt, so he has:\n\n$357.14 - $200 = $157.14\n\nleft after buying the shirt.\n\nTherefore, Mike will have $157.14 after spending some of his share on a shirt that costs $200.",

Johnson's share is 5/7 of the total profit, which is $2500. So the total profit is $2500 * (7/5) = $3500. Mike's share is $3500 * (2/7) = $1000. After spending $200 on a shirt, Mike will have $1000 - $200 = $800."
