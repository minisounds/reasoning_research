Let's break it down step by step:

1. Ken starts with a box that weighs an unknown amount. He adds enough jelly beans to bring the weight to 2 pounds. So, the box now weighs 2 pounds.
2. Then, he adds enough brownies to triple the weight. Since the box weighs 2 pounds, tripling the weight would make it 2 x 3 = 6 pounds.
3. Next, he adds another 2 pounds of jelly beans. This brings the total weight to 6 pounds + 2 pounds = 8 pounds.
4. Finally, he adds enough gummy worms to double the weight once again. Since the box weighs 8 pounds, doubling the weight would make it 8 x 2 = 16 pounds.

So, the final weight of the box of goodies is 16 pounds.

Let's first calculate the total amount Alexis spent on the clothes she bought:

$30 (shirt) + $46 (pants) + $38 (coat) + $11 (socks) + $18 (belt) = $143

She has $16 left from her budget, which means she spent a total of:

$200 (budget) - $16 (left) = $184

Since she spent a total of $143 on the clothes, that means she spent:

$184 (total spent) - $143 (clothes) = $41

on the shoes.

step 1: calculate the overtime hours
Tina works 10 hours per day. 8 hours is regular pay, and 2 hours is overtime. So, for 5 days, she works 2 * 5 = 10 hours of overtime.

step 2: calculate the regular pay
Tina works 8 hours per day for 5 days. So, she works 8 * 5 = 40 hours of regular pay. Her regular pay is 40 * 18 = 720 dollars.

step 3: calculate the overtime pay
Tina works 10 hours of overtime. Her overtime pay is 10 * (18 + 9) = 10 * 27 = 270 dollars.

step 4: calculate the total pay
Tina's total pay is the sum of her regular pay and overtime pay. So, her total pay is 720 + 270 = 990 dollars.

step 1: the monster ate 847 people over 3 hundred years. step 2: the monster eats 1 ship every 100 years. step 3: the monster eats 3 ships over 3 hundred years. step 4: the first ship had x people. step 5: the second ship had 2x people. step 6: the third ship had 4x people. step 7: x + 2x + 4x = 847. step 8: 7x = 847. step 9: x = 847 / 7. step 10: x = 121.

step 1: calculate how much money Tobias has saved up in 3 months. 3 months x 5 dollars a month = 15 dollars. step 2: calculate how much money Tobias made from mowing lawns. 4 lawns x 15 dollars a lawn = 60 dollars. step 3: calculate how much money Tobias has left after buying the shoes. 95 dollars (cost of shoes) - 15 dollars (change) = 80 dollars. step 4: calculate how much money Tobias has left after saving up and mowing lawns. 80 dollars - 15 dollars (saved up) - 60 dollars (mowing lawns) = 5 dollars. step 5: calculate how much money Tobias made from shoveling driveways. 5 dollars - 15 dollars (cost of shoes) = -10 dollars. step 6: calculate how much money Tobias made from shoveling driveways per driveway. -10 dollars /? driveways =? dollars per driveway. step 7: solve for? driveways.? driveways x 7 dollars per driveway = -10 dollars.? driveways = -10 dollars / 7 dollars per driveway = 1

step 1: find the number of coconut trees. half of 60 is 30. 5 less than 30 is 30 - 5 = 25. step 2: add the number of mango trees and coconut trees. 60 + 25 = 85. The answer is 85.

step 1: Determine the cost of the cream cheese. The cream cheese costs half the price of the cheddar cheese. So the cream cheese costs 10 / 2 = 5 dollars. Step 2: Determine the cost of the cold cuts. The cold cuts cost twice the price of the cheddar cheese. So the cold cuts cost 10 * 2 = 20 dollars. Step 3: Determine the total cost. The total cost is the cost of the cheddar cheese, the cream cheese, and the cold cuts. So the total cost is 10 + 5 + 20 = 35 dollars. The answer is 35.

step 1: find out how many pages Joy can read in 1 minute. Joy can read 8 pages in 20 minutes. So she can read 8 / 20 = 0.4 pages in 1 minute. step 2: find out how many pages Joy can read in 1 hour. Joy can read 0.4 pages in 1 minute. So she can read 0.4 * 60 = 24 pages in 1 hour. step 3: find out how many hours it will take Joy to read 120 pages. Joy can read 24 pages in 1 hour. So it will take her 120 / 24 = 5 hours to read 120 pages. The answer is 5 hours.

step 1: calculate the cost of making a movie
cost of making a movie = $2000

step 2: calculate the cost of making a DVD
cost of making a DVD = $6

step 3: calculate the selling price of a DVD
selling price of a DVD = $6 * 2.5 = $15

step 4: calculate the profit per DVD
profit per DVD = selling price of a DVD - cost of making a DVD = $15 - $6 = $9

step 5: calculate the number of DVDs sold per day
number of DVDs sold per day = 500

step 6: calculate the number of DVDs sold per week
number of DVDs sold per week = 500 * 5 = 2500

step 7: calculate the number of DVDs sold in 20 weeks
number of DVDs sold in 20 weeks = 2500 * 20 = 50,000

step 8: calculate the total profit
total profit = number of DVDs sold in 20 weeks * profit per DVD = 50,000 * $9 = $450,000
